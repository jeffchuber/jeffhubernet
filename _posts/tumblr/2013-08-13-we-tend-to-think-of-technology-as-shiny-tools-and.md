title: ! 'We tend to think of technology as shiny tools and gadgets. Even if we acknowledge
  that technology can exist in disembodied form, such as software, we tend not to
  include in this category paintings, literature, music, dance, poetry, and the arts
  in general. But we should. If a thousand lines of letters in UNIX qualifies as a
  technology (the computer code for a web page), then a thousand lines of letters
  in English (Hamlet) must qualify as well. They both can change our behavior, alter
  the course of events, or enable future inventions. A Shakespeare sonnet and a Bach
  fugue, then, are in the same category as Google’s search engine and the iPod: They
  are something useful produced by a mind… Both are useful works of the human imagination.
  Both influence audiences powerfully. Both are technological.'
