My answer to What are the libertarian answers to why salaries of CEOs are rising while workers’ wages are declining? on Quora
I’ve appreciated and learned from the other answers on this page but I feel none really answer the question. It’s technology’s fault.Businesses are all about making decisions. The high leverage decisions are the valuable ones. Technology has changed the organizational structure so that CEOs have more real decision making power (better information, better communication) and thus provide more real value to the company. I would almost posture a new law 
If a new technology enables a decision to be passed up the value chain - then it will be passed up the value chain.
Technology is not some great leveler of the the playing field or some magical jobs creator. Technology replaces jobs that shouldn’t exist anymore. To create jobs, technology must create more decisions than it replaces.So you have two trends. A. Technology replaces jobs with automation. Technology creates jobs by creating new decisions. Which is greater?B. Technology concentrates decision making power. The more high leverage decisions someone makes (or is perceived to make, or is perceived as being responsible for) - the more valuable they are to the company.CEOs of the past could play golf 4 times a week. Most of their managers made the decisions and the CEO concentrated on pulling regulatory strings and finding tax loopholes (sarcasm, sort of). This made sense when insight was difficult and communication was difficult. But in this new age:
The touch on the iPad is mightier than the golf swing
