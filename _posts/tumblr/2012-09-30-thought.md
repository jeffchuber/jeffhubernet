Something I wrote a year ago:

It is ironic how a stream of consciousness journal requires one to be mindful of one’s thoughts which ultimately is the thing to be achieved. The desired end result. To be conscious of the present. 

Take control of your mind. The irony lies in that reflecting on the past - you gain the present. And when you gain the present - you have the power to take on the future. Be intentional with your next hour, your day, this year, and your life. Life’s too short to do anything else.
