Phones are a distraction.
Everyone complains about it. “I can’t live without my phone.” “I can’t even go to the loo without playing a game.” Etc, etc. But almost no one does anything about it.
Everyone has those friends that clutch their 5 year old dumb phones for dear life. (if they break it - the carrier literally will only have smart phones) That has always been a little extreme for me. I like to take the next app for a spin and it’s true that I couldn’t live without Google Maps. Plus - those people invariably get weird looks from people trying to figure out if they are the unibomber or just a Luddite. 
So how can we have our cake and eat it too? How can we not succumb to the ADD economy where every spare second must be filled - while not living in the past and accepting technological platforms that allow for serendipity and exploration of culture and life? (Wikipedia anyone?)
My solution has been this: 


By removing everything from the home page I avoid those little colorful gems begging to be clicked every time I check the time. I also have removed all games (because I know I get addicted and fast). When I really need an app fast - ill just search for it. 
So far it’s been a great success. I’ve purposely made my phone a little less convenient (albeit a lot more minimalist) and have cut down on phantom tremors in my leg - and hopefully that means I care a little less about the like on Instagram or the retweet on twitter. And my trips to the loo are a little more meditative.
