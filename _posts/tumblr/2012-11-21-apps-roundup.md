Finding apps is a weirdly hard process. What apps to my friends love and use everyday? Do I really have to ask them and be that annoying new guy who just got an iPhone? Seemingly yes I do. So to spare you the trouble (although feel free to ask me), these are the apps I like: [updated November 20, 2012]

Home Screen
Chrome Browser: WAY better than Safari. Nice tab management. Syncing of bookmarks, history, and open tabs with your desktop. Awesome.
Calendar: Gets the first slot because managing my calendar is not my strong suit. 
Notes: Great for jotting down stuff. The sync with mountain lion over iCloud is really phenomenal. 
Clear: A wonderful to-do list app. Simple, beautiful, clever. Clear also just released a Mac app that auto-syncs. 
Photos: Obvious
Spotify: Makes thinking about and listening to music seamless. It’s a really interesting experience to have. Syncs with the mac app as well and soon the web client.
Sparrow: A good email client. I also use the Mac version. I just wish it was updated for the iPhone 5’s screen height
Path: Share moments with close friends. I use this for more personal things than I’m willing to put on Facebook.
Pair: Share moments with my fiance Bridget. 
Lift: Goal setting. 
Bible: Obvious
Kindle: Books
Pocket: Save articles from browser and autodelivered and optimized for mobile.
Foursquare: It’s on my home screen because I am interested in experimenting with life-logging where I go. However I am very bad at remembering to do so. Not sure it will stay here much longer.
App Store: Obvious
Trello: Tracking larger projects. I track my company’s progress here and even do some personal planning.
Clock: My alarm- It isn’t great but I haven’t found a better solution
AccuWeather: I don’t know why this is here.
Maps: I love in a city is navigation is sometimes important.
Transit: A nifty little public transit routing application that makes up for all the downfalls of Apple Maps (no public transit routing)
Other apps not on the home screen:
Amazon: makes ordering those essentials easy to do on the go.
Square Wallet: Basically only use this with the food trucks, but it’s a fun way to pay. 
Cardmunch: Scan a business card and automatically have all the info digitized including a link to the person’s linkedIn. Really great.
Google Drive: Just nice to have for accessing Google Docs. 
Yelp: Find great restaurants.
Photosynth: Easily great amazing 360 panoramas. 
Social Apps that I have but try not to use: Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, Quora
