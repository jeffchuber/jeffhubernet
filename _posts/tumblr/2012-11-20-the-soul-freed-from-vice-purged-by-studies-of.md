title: The soul, — freed from vice, purged by studies of true philosophy, versed in
  spiritual life, and practised in matters of the intellect, devoted to the contemplation
  of her own substance, — as if awakened from deepest sleep, opens those eyes which
  all possess but few use, and sees in herself a ray of that light which is the true
  image of the angelic beauty communicated to her, and of which she then communicates
  a faint shadow to the body.
