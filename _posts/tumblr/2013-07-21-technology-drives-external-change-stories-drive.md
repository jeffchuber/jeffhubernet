title: Technology drives external change, Stories drive internal change.

Technology drives external change. It forces people to adopt new habits. It changes habits. Cell phones forced the societal expectation that you have to be accessible all the time, everywhere. 
Stories drive internal change. Stories cause us to aspire to greatness. Reading Man’s Search for Meaning can change your life. Stories change our hearts and our desires.
If you want to create a better world - both are necessary. 
Technology is the vehicle. Technology sets up the constraints. Technology is the cell phone. 
Stories are the message. Stories help us pick the best option within the constraints. 
Now that you have a communication device in your pocket all the time, are you going to use that power for good or evil? 
The cell phone doesn’t care. But your literary hero probably does.
( ps - can government set up constraints as effectively as technology? )
