Great products are built one way only - when every person feels responsibility and ownership of the product from the vision to deploying production. This culture blossoms out of one where the leadership sets a tone relentless self-improvement, humility, honesty, and gratitude. That is the kind of culture that great engineers want - and the kind of culture that great leaders build.

A man walked up to three masons who were chipping away at granite. He asked the first mason what he was doing. The first mason answered, “I am chipping away at this granite of course.” So the man asked the second mason what he was doing. The second replied, “Oh! I am helping build this wall so the building will be strong, straight, and true.” Still not satisfied, the man asked the third mason what he was doing. The third answered, “I am building the most beautiful cathedral the world has ever seen dedicated to the Almighty Lord.”

This is an apt analogy, building software is building cathedrals out of air.
An example of the traditional product process is:

The executive team puts forth the vision and works with product to lay out the user stories, features, and UI. This is handed to engineering and they are told to build it.

This has worked for a long time and continues to work for companies with 100s of software engineers with no entrepreneurial bone in their body. In fact, you need this level of control when you work at a large boring company that people who want steady, boring jobs are attracted to. Their work pays the bills and that’s about it. Why would you ever allow them to contribute their thoughts to something like vision, strategy or product?  You shouldn’t.
Startups are completely different. They don’t draw the engineer who is only in it for the paycheck. They attract the kind of person who is creative, innovative and loves thinking about hard problems in engineering, and out of engineering. They will not be pigeon-holed.
People will almost always perform within the bounds that we give them. If we give engineers no responsibly outside of implementation, we will burn them out and they will find their creative outlet elsewhere. (and creative outlets become startups) However if we want to have high retention and a culture that attracts the best, brightest, and most creative engineers - we must give them ownership and a voice.
Companies need to act their stage. Large companies have certain patterns of success that are touted as being ideal project management and leadership strategies. That’s all well and good but more often than not the most successful startups are black swans. Black swans almost never occur from strict, careful, top-down planning. They happen by planning for serendipity and assembling a team that are all invested in making that black swan a reality. 
I would encourage you - my fellow startup friends - to consider how the culture is being crafted at the place you work. Is each employee being given the responsibility and the prerogative to make the company great? How can you be the change?
