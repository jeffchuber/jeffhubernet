There is an aphorism that is often said - “You can’t have something until you are willing to give it up.” I think this is a core truth. For example things that I think are true:

- You can’t be original unless you are willing to be not original.
- You can’t be wealthy until you are willing to be poor.
- You can’t be powerful unless you are willing to be weak.
- You can’t be happy unless you are willing to sacrifice your own happiness. 
- You can’t love unless you are willing to not be loved.

Wealth, power, fame, comfort, safety, happiness — all the things that humans seek actually control us and are chains which bind us. Devotion to the pursuit of any of these things is a god we have made in our own minds. A god meaning something which we think if we can attain will be happy. (You know something falls into this category if you have or would lie to get it.)

- If you are so focused on becoming wealthy - you will likely never feel that you have enough.
- If you are so focused on being powerful - you will likely never be happy with the influence you have and paranoia and insecurity will devour any power you might have. 
- If you are so focused on being original as an artist - you will so obsess over what others have done and what others will thinks that you will never be able to truly look inside yourself and find the genius within. 
- If you are so focused on being loved - you will always be incredibly insecure and never find true relationship. 

This strikes a lot of people at first like ascetism and detachment are then the correct courses to pursue. But this is wrong and completely and obviously so. If you are seeking simplicity and detachment for your own happiness, you will never find it. 

What this really means is that if you pursue selfish gain, you will never reap the rewards. Individualism is so corruptive. It teaches us to maximize our individual gain - but it seems that the focus on maximizing our own share is what also guarentees we will never be able to enjoy what we have. Only by seeking the good of others first, truly for it’s own sake, will be able to be wealthy, and powerful, and loved, and original, and happy, and free.

This has pretty disturbing applications for entrepreneurship. For instance - I do not get along well with those that are starting companies for overtly selfish reasons. And anecdotally I would wager they are worse entrepreneurs. Given a spare second - they think about themselves and not their customer. That’s a worrying sign.

However I get along really well with those that are doing what they do because they love the people that have the problem they are trying to solve. These entrepreneurs want to serve their customers by truly understanding their problem and their need with empathy and compassion so that they can devise the best solution to make the pain go away. What an honest and noble quest. 

**Making the world more like it should be by caring enough for those that have the problem to do something and do it with all your heart. **

It is not done for selfish want or gain but for love for others and mankind (even if they don’t love you back). The top 1% of entrepreneurs don’t ever care to start companies at all. They simply use a company as a structure to make an effective, scalable and sustainable impact. The best entrepreneurs in the world love their customer more than themselves and love their employees more than themselves. They do what they do because they recognize the world sucks - and they care enough to fix it - even if they become martyrs along the way. Are you willing to make that sacrifice? If I were an investor that is the only thing kind of person I would invest in because those are the people that change the world.

Pride will always hold you back - love will always drive you forward.
