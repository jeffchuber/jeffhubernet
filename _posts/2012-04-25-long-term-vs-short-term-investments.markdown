Can functions that non profits be turned into corporations with interests in profit? I think not. 

To have the ecosystem where short term profits are obvious and accessible requires long term investments with a higher built in uncertainty factor. To be able to access short term profits, long term risk must be taken. Since this risk is not palpable to classic investors, governments and non profits operate to make these investments without an expectation of return. That sort of sucks too. Somehow we need society to accept a hybrid where this entity isn’t expected to return a profit, but rather a 50% return. This would also help with the sustainability of non profits.

The problem of course is one of psychology and the changing relationship between an investment and a donation. A large enough fund - may be able to spread the risk around enough (like a large VC) that they could break even. Microfinancing has proven promising in this because if you reduce the investment down to a single profitable enterprise (building a small store) - the risk is significantly reduced. But it still isn’t clear to me that micro financing can provide the sort of financing that developing countries need to build up to where classic institutional short term profits are obvious and available.

It seems some outside body must make the investments where the returns are not needed or expected.
