Born in Palo Alto. Grew up outside Raleigh North Carolina. Currently Living in San&nbsp;Francisco.&nbsp;

At school I studied Economics and Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering before I [dropped out](http://www.caldwellfellows.com/2011/06/im-nuts-for-startups/). I was able to design and teach 2 undergraduate courses called Lifestyle Design and The Superstar Effect with [Garik](https://twitter.com/gcsadovy).

Iâ€™m half Danish and have lived in Copenhagen. My grandfather was a newspaperman and knighted by the Queen.

I care greatly about design. I am very fond of&nbsp;Scandinavian&nbsp;Design. I think the most interesting things in life are those of craft - where art meets technology.

I am philosopher by night and Christian all the time. I am heavily influenced by the work of Francis Schaeffer. I am extremely interested how the gospel changes work. I gave a [TEDx talk on happiness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYtPmxnSnJg).

I work in technology because I believe that technology is the most scalable way to make an impact in the world.

I have no left foot and wear a prosthetic leg. I aslo have a running leg.

Topics we should connect about: Architecture, Education, Product Design, Philosophy, Street Photography and hyyge.

ENTP.
