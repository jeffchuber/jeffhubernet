Walking around San Francisco desensitizes you to a lot of things, including people in the most dire of straits. They are the homeless, the drug addicts, those down on their luck. They are ubiquitous - nearly on every street corner. Some actively ask you for a quarter, 50 cents, or a ticket for the bus, but most sit there with a cardboard sign. It is so commonplace that we cease to view them as humans just like us, with hopes, and dreams, and in need of love and meaning.

It’s really sad. This social ostracism is what stirs their fears and drives them back into the ground even harder. The homelessness problem is an incredibly complex one with no simple solutions and no easy ones. I don’t know pretend to have an answer to solve it but I do wonder about how we can force awareness and increase empathy. It’s a good place to start.

I was riding the Metro the other day in the same car as a homeless guy. He was wearing a  really nice jacket with Slide’s logo on the chest (Max Levchin’s company that sold to Google for $182M). While this is nothing out of the ordinary, the thing that really struck me is that I noticed. And I remembered. And that I’m writing about it now. This sort of jacket is normally the type that you would expect a VC or a CEO to wear, certainly not someone like that. 

Why does this matter? Because I found myself spending the time to consider **who** that person was - in the same way I would if they were a VC or CEO. These positions are closest to my personal goals and thus closest to my humanity. So we have that which is closest to my humanity being worn by a person who is seemingly farthest from it. It was a really wonderful dichotomy. And it made me stop and think.

The only way to get entrepreneurs to solve the really big problems in the world is to figure out how to stir up real empathy. Knowledge is not the problem. Maybe giving out startup tshirts and jackets to the least of us is the first step.
