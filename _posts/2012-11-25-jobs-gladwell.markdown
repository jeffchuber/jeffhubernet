In June, Malcolm Gladwell made the comment that “And of the great entrepreneurs of this era people will have forgotten Steve Jobs. Who’s Steve Jobs again?” This rustled a lot of feathers especially among the tech community. 

*“Steve Jobs was a genius! Who does this Malcolm guy think he is anyway!?”*

There was a lot of spirited [debate](http://www.quora.com/Steve-Jobs/Was-Malcolm-Gladwell-right-to-say-that-Steve-Jobs-will-be-forgotten-in-50-years). Some people noted previous titans of industry that have long since been forgotten. Some said that Gladwell was simply (very effectively) generating press and selling books. 

Whether or whether not Steve Jobs will be remembered is an interesting question but not one I want to address here. What fascinates me is how passionate people were about defending Steve Jobs and I think the reason is pretty clear. 

Steve Jobs was and is one of the heros of the tech community. He was not just our hero but the ambassador for our community to the world. [We wanted to believe that technology could save the world - and it seems that perhaps we needed a magician named Steve Jobs to convince us of that](/iphone-5/). 

But why is the notion that your hero will be forgotten so upsetting? For instance if I were to tell you that in 50 years no one would know who Batman is - that probably wouldn’t upset you very much. I think the **reason** it is so upsetting is because it drives at the existential quandary we all find ourselves in. If the name of our hero doesn’t even make it 50 years, what hope is there for our names? If our names do not outlive us - what purpose and meaning did this life have? We want to believe that Steve Jobs will be remembered with the hope that in the best case we will be remembered also, and in the worst that at least our blood, sweat, and tears we will live on through his name.
