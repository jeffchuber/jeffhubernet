Birthdays are strange things aren’t they?

Part of us wants to eschew the attention, because we know it’s not warranted. So we happen to be born on this day. Why should you love me any more this day than any other day? Why is this day 23 years later special? 

But we all secretly love our birthdays too. A day about us! Heck yea! Not in a bad way - but a good excuse for friends past and friends now to get out from behind their own insecurities and say how much they love us. Such well wishes would be a little weird any other day of the year.

Maybe that’s why birthdays are a little sad too. Birthdays remind us of our humanity.  Our actions and the actions of our friends remind us of our fears and weaknesses. Maybe that’s why so many people escape on their birthdays, to a remote location by themselves or to alcohol surrounded with friends. Same thing.
