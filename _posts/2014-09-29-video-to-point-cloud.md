Your iPhone, or any smartphone, or device capable of recording video, is actually a very powerful tool to create 3d representations of your world. It's really easy, and only requires a few free software packages. It is possible to do on a Mac, but the free software we are going to use today runs best on PC, so the tutorial will be for PC! (I'm using windows 8)

In my opinion, this solution is also better than solutions like 123d Catch (free software from Autodesk) where you have to take up to 60 images at precise points. It's just too difficult to encourage a lot of people to play around a lot with it. Anyone can take a video! (123d catch does have other nice features, so I encourage you to check it out too)

As you can see there are just a few simple steps I'm going to walk you through in more detail:

1. Record the video

2. Turn the video into images

3. Turn the images into a point cloud

4. View the point cloud, and do more cool stuff!

This can only be used for academic and non-commercial uses because of restrictions with the underlying software we will use.
