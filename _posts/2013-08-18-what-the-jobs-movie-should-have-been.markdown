I saw Kutcher’s *Jobs* on Friday night and sadly wasn’t impressed. There was no conflict, no build up, and it dragged on and on and on. I literally almost fell asleep (it was a late showing and a long week albeit). For a movie about someone that is something of a personal hero of mine - that really kinda sucked.

This afternoon, I watched the [interview](http://www.bloomberg.com/video/wozniak-says-lot-of-things-wrong-with-jobs-movie-Mm1dnrz8QJuikP6iFdCJmQ.html) on Bloomberg with Woz about the movie. He touched on how while Steve was a great visionary, he wasn’t a great executor in the early days of Apple, and did do a lot of things that were bad for Apple. (which led to him getting kicked out) It was only after coming back from NeXT (‘85-‘97 - 12 years!) that he had both the vision and the abilities to execute. 

That should have been the story. It is truly the [hero’s journey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth).


> Miraculous conception and birth - childhood

> Initiation of the hero-child - HP and atari

> Withdrawal from family or community for meditation and preparation - Reed college

> Trial and Quest - Apple is birthed

> Death - Steve gets kicked out

> **Descent into the underworld - hard years at NeXT**

> Resurrection and rebirth - Apple buys NeXT and Steve returns as CEO

> Ascension, apotheosis, and atonement - the iPod, iPhone, Macbooks, iPad

6 should have been the focus of the movie. It is what would have humanized Jobs and made the audience relate to him. It is the struggle that *Jobs* was missing.
