title:  "Optimize Meaning Over Happiness"

It is common wisdom that people try to maximize happiness. And that seems to be true from my experience. I find that my friends often talk about doing something because they believe it will make them more happy. When they ask us for our opinion - "Do what makes you happy" we tell them.

But is that actually true? Are we simply leading our friends and family astray?

> Don't aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long-run—in the long-run, I say!—success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it. - Victor Frankl

Next time you are making a decision - don't ask *what will make me happiest?*, but rather *what carries the most meaning?*

We live for meaning, not happiness.
