Back to school is in the air and everyone is talking about education again. Reid Hoffman published a blog post recently that made waves and strategies to "fix" education line the covers of magazines and bookshelves. It's a sexy topic - one that legislators call to focus on day in and day out. "Put more American kids through college", "Make an American education competitive again", blah blah, you get the idea.

So we are all talking all about education - that's great. But what is education anyway? Where did it come from? Why do we have it? Who uses the service of education today and what motivations drive them? If you are going to fix a product or servce - you had better understand these questions and more. But no one *is* answering these questions. Education is like the Pope, it is just good and that's the way it always will be, don't question it.

Where did Education come from? Historically education can be boiled down to something as simple as imparting knowledge or information from one person to another. But that definition isn't really that helpful. Watching ESPN non-stop is "getting an education" - but not one that our leaders are talking about. "Getting an education" or a university education is a more modern concept that originated with the class that most advancements originate with - the bourgeoisie.

When a young wealthy man came of age he would set off to be educated by the brightest and most scholarly minds of his day. His father would send him off - not to better his future per se - but to protect the family estate as well as the same sense of virtue that we all feel surrounding being educated. This lad would go learn logic, rhetoric, Latin and build friendships with other sons of other powerful families. This bolstered the family's position by creating new business and by discouraging recklessness - now the boy had friends whom he respected. Peer pressure rocks.

The university then, think Oxford and Cambridge, is a very attractive place. It holds the relationships that hold the keys to wealth, fame, and power. Getting a degree from Oxford didn't really "get you a job" - because generally the job was based on a connection to begin with. They didn't really need to compete - most of the time they just took over their family businesses.

Once the middle classes began to boom with the industrial revolution - more and more students went to college. They went because they too wanted wealth, fame and power - but they more wanted the security those jobs held just on the other side of the degree. More and more students went to college - got their degree - and joined IBM or many other large companies for life. Good pay, good benefits, security. The American Dream.

Jobs are a marketplace. There is a supply, and there is demand. Both affect how competitive candidates need to be. What we have seen in the last 10-15 years is a stagnation in the growth of jobs compared to the growth in students with degrees. The supply of jobs is getting smaller and the demand for jobs is getting bigger. So degrees matter even more. This is why some hiring managers receive 800+ resumes (with accompanying degrees) for 1 entry level job. Hiring managers need simple heuristics they can understand like (1) degree, (2) GPA, (3) school tier to weed through this stack and get it down to a manageable level. If you even want to make the cut for the first job to get your life started - it's time to plop down 10K or more like 120K for a degree.

Why people go to college today.

I would posit that people go to college for two reasons. (1) To learn, (2) To gain a more secure life. Historically learning meant a more secure life - but we don't have any way anymore to measure how and what people learned because the degree has become commoditized.

People who go to college to learn probably won't ever have a problem getting a job. They are self-directed, self-starters, grab-life-by-the-horns, carpe-diem kinds of people. How else could they know how they want to spend their life at 18? A lot of chutzpah or a long family lineage and connections. This is Reid Hoffman, and this was me. How big is this population of all college attendees? It's hard to estimate - but I would say 5%.

Then there are people who go to college to improve their security or chances at life. While the student themselves might not be thinking this - their parents definitely are. In their generation a degree meant a good life and to them that hasn't changed. (To our congressmen that hasn't changed either.) For this person: college functions as an insurance policy. It improves your chances of not being impoverished or on the street. *** throw in a Peter Thiel quote***

So you say you want to fix education? We have just discovered that there are two very different problems called "education".

(1) There is making learning better.

(2) There is making insurance better.

For making learning better - your first WWW stop should be MinervaProject.com. Check out the amazing stuff that Ben Nelson is doing. Then read about how corporations funding education could be the revival of apprenticeships. You have probably already read a lot about or even participated in a MOOC.

For making insurance better, there are two leverage points.

(1) Change the heursitic that hiring agents use.

(2) Change the way that parents are able to invest in their child's long term success.

Both of these are actually very interesting propositions.

My previous company, Knowit, attempted to do #1. We built software that allowed recruiters to more easily build relationships with potential candidates by using the content that they shared online to judge their knowledge and self-direction as well as know how to connect and relate to that person. The hope was that by using this kind of data with recruiters (more open to novel techniques since they have more competition that internal HR departments) it would trickle into organizations until eventually someone's Knowit score or some alternative was used to filter -- At first in addition to a degree, and then once it was seen to be better - instead of a degree. The logic here is pretty obvious. Only hiring people with college degrees is kind of like only hiring white upper class males. You limit a lot of your downside statistically (at least historically) - but limit your upside completely.

Number 2 is even more interesting. What if parents could pay into a life quality insurance policy for their child from birth instead of a college savings fund? The beauty of applying insurance to problems is that you create a market for research to be conducted on what parenting techniques actually work. The insurance company that has the best algorithm can offer the best rates and make the most profit. Parents would pay premiums depending on their determined risk. The insurance policy could fund education if that was the child truly wanted when the time came - but they could also place the child at in network jobs or do more basic training programs or apprenticeships to assure the person always had a job and was never on the street.

To summarize: the word education is nefarious and vague. If you want to understand the problem - you have to understand the motivations. There are huge opportunities in education - but they aren't necessarily the obvious thing that everyone thinks of.
